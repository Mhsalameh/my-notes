## Introduction
My name is Mohammad Salameh, I am 26 years old, I studied mechanical engineering in *JUST*. 
I have some exeprience in sales engineering but I didn't find it as my niche. So I am now hopefully making a creer shift into development.

## The developer's mindset
As a developer it's important to have a mindset and use it to avoid implementing unnecessary code or throwing it all away and starting over, and help you make a scalable secure program.

### Key points to master
1. **Understand the purpose of of the software**
> - If you don't understand the purpose you will write bad software
2. **you are a designer**
> - Your design should be easy for you and helpful for others.
3. **Missunderstanding leads to complexity**
> - It's simple, bad developers don't understand what they are doing.
4. **Simplicity**
> - Don't act smart, be smart; good developers will simplify the code, bad developers will complicate it.
5. **Complexity**
> - Control the complexity of your softwar, but planning ahead, understading you software and ressisting unnecessary change.
6. **Maintenance**
> - Manage implementation of change, make your code more scalable by balancing between "ease" simplicity and "effort" complexity 
7. **Consistency**
> - Code that is not consistent with it's naming and functionality is hard to understand.
8. **Prioritizing**
> - It's all about making decisions, but how? **D=V/E**.
>> Where **D** is desirablity, **V** is Value, **E** is the effort required.
>> More value less effor is more disireable.
9. **Problem solving**
> - Understand the problem, plan "but not too much planning", and then devide it into smaller tasks.
10. **The good enough mentality**
> - Don't chace for perfection first step. Start small, improve it, then extend.
11. **Predictions**
> - You can't predict the future, instead be only as generic as you need to be right now.
12. **Assumptions**
> - Assumptions can kill softwares, design code base on what you know now.
13. **Stop Reinventing**
> - You already have a garbage collector why create a new one? *Don't reinvent the wheel*.
14. **Resistance**
> - *NO* more code, until you are convinced that they are essential.
15. **Automation**
> - Repetitave is boring and a waste of time. Don't waste your time.
16. **Code Measurment**
> - Code lines isn't a way of measuring the progress and quality of a software.
17. **Productivity** 
> - How can I remove more code mindset
18. **Testing**
> - Test, test, test, and test again.
19. **Underestimations**
> - Break to smaller things that are easier to estimate rather than estimating one big thing as a whole and miss your deadline.
20. **Rewriting code is a delusion**
> - It's harder to read code than writing it.
> - [Cases](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/lessons-learned-in-my-10-years-as-a-developer-3d33c8702828/) that are ok to rewrite code with.
21. **Documentation and commenting**
> - Commenting shouldn't describe what a code does, it should already be clear from the code itself. comments should mention why you wrote the code.
22. **Picking technologies**
> - There are a lot of tools to use out there, try to reduce your dependency on them.
23. **Self Development**
> - Learn more, deep sea of knowledge.
